  <p>There are many bands in the world that perform all kinds of music. Let's suppose for a second that you're a fan of rock and want to create a program that deals with rock bands.</p> 
  <p>For that, you&nbsp;obviously&nbsp;need the class <strong>RockBand&nbsp;</strong>with such attributes as&nbsp;<strong>genre&nbsp;</strong>("rock"),&nbsp;<strong>n_members&nbsp;</strong>(4, by default) and&nbsp;<strong>famous_songs&nbsp;</strong>(an empty list as a default value). Create this class and an object of that class: name the variable after any rock band that you like.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Print the attributes of your rock band on separate lines in this order:&nbsp;<strong>genre,&nbsp;</strong><strong>n_members, famous_songs.</strong></p>
